Treat is a toolkit for natural language processing and computational linguistics in Ruby. It provides a common API for a number of gems and external libraries for document retrieval, parsing, annotation, and information extraction.

**Current features**

* Text extractors for PDF, HTML, XML, Word, AbiWord, OpenOffice and image formats (Ocropus)
* Text retrieval with indexation and full-text search (Ferret)
* Text chunkers, sentence segmenters, tokenizers, and parsers for several languages (Stanford & Enju)
* Word inflectors, including stemmers, conjugators, declensors, and number inflection
* Lexical resources (WordNet interface, several POS taggers for English, Stanford taggers for several languages)
* Language, date/time, topic words (LDA) and keyword (TF*IDF) extraction.
* Simple text statistics (frequency, TF*IDF)
* Serialization of annotated entities to YAML or XML format
* Visualization in ASCII tree, directed graph (DOT) and tag-bracketed (standoff) formats
* Linguistic resources, including full ISO-639-1 and ISO-639-2 support, and tag alignments for several treebanks
